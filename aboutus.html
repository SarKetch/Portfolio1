                   From 1875 to Today
                </h3>
            <p>
                <span>Our treasured estate narrates a tale of transformation, determination, and evolution.</span>
                Originally constructed by cotton merchant Elias Williams, this historic residence underwent a series of changes throughout its first century, a period during which detailed records were somewhat elusive.
                </p>  
           
            <p>During the late 1970s, the property underwent a significant transformation. A fireplace was removed, and the existing porches were enclosed, giving rise to two sunrooms, an elegant entry hall, and a spacious master suite. It was during this era that Rocky Bradford became the second historically notable owner, acquiring the property in 1972 and holding it until 1982. However, this period also saw a darker chapter in the home's history, as it became embroiled in a significant drug operation and became the first house to be seized by the government in the war on drugs. Consequently, it passed into government ownership from 1982 to 1984.</p>
            
            <p>In 1984, the property was sold at auction to Pete Duncan and his wife, Anita, marking a new chapter in its history. Over the years, the estate remained in the Duncan family and was eventually passed on to their children in 2019.</p>
             
            <p>Today, this historic residence is undergoing its second major renovation, a testament to the dedication of its custodians to preserve its unique heritage. The property boasts numerous enhancements made by previous owners, such as the addition of a pool and a pool house, both of which were constructed during Rocky Bradford's ownership in the late 1970s. In 1992, a garage was added by Pete and John, further enhancing the estate's functionality.</p>
                
            <p>In 2016, the property witnessed a significant expansion when additional land was incorporated, leading to the creation of the grand driveway that we enjoy today. The culmination of this vision was realized in 2023, when the grand drive was completed, adding a magnificent finishing touch to the remarkable history of this estate</p>
