                Our treasured estate narrates a tale of transformation, determination, and evolution.
                Originally constructed by cotton merchant Elias Williams, this historic residence has witnessed a series of changes,
                especially during its first century when detailed records remained elusive. Over the years, the house has been a silent
                observer to historical moments and significant architectural modifications, each telling a different chapter of its
                enduring story
                </p>  
            <p>In the late 1970s, the property saw a significant transformation under Rocky Bradford, the second historically notable
            owner. A fireplace was removed, and the porches were enclosed, birthing two sunrooms, an elegant entry hall, and a
            spacious master suite. During Bradford's ownership in the 1970s, the property was enhanced with the addition of a pool
            and pool house. However, a shadow was cast upon this illustrious history when it became embroiled in a substantial drug
            operation, leading to its seizure by the government in the war on drugs. For a brief period, from 1982 to 1984, the
            residence was under government ownership.</p>
            <p>The year 1984 heralded a fresh start when Pete Duncan and his wife, Anita, acquired the estate at an auction. The property remained a prized possession
            of the Duncan family and was given to their children in 2019. A significant expansion occurred in 2016, with the
            integration of additional land, culminating in the creation of the grand driveway we admire today. This vision was fully
            realized in 2023, solidifying the estate's rich legacy and its unwavering charm through the ages.</p>
